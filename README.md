# FIFA Player Data Analysis and Modeling Project

**Author:** Christian Huerta  

## 📌 Project Purpose
This project analyzes a large dataset of FIFA soccer players using machine learning and data exploration techniques. It is designed to showcase real-world applications of big data tools such as MongoDB, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and pandas-based analysis.

## ❓ Research Questions
- Can we classify players into rating tiers using K-Nearest Neighbors?
- What physical or technical attributes most influence player ratings?
- How can we query and analyze soccer data using MongoDB?
- What trends emerge in player attributes like sprint speed, acceleration, and ball control?

## 📊 Dataset Summary
- **File:** `fifa_players.csv`
- **Rows:** 17,954 players
- **Columns:** 51
- **Key Features:** 
  - Player attributes: rating, potential, age, height, weight
  - Skill metrics: passing, finishing, ball control, sprint speed, strength
  - Metadata: nationality, position, value, wage, team details

## 📁 Notebooks
1. **CISD 43 - Template- Code.ipynb** – Main project notebook combining modeling and analysis
2. **Soccer Coding KNN.ipynb** – K-Nearest Neighbors classification of player ratings
3. **Soccer Players.ipynb** – MongoDB-based exploration and querying of soccer data

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas & NumPy**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**
- **MongoDB (via PyMongo)**
- **Scikit-learn** – for KNN modeling

## 🔍 Key Findings
- Physical stats such as sprint speed, acceleration, and strength show a measurable effect on overall rating.
- KNN classifier performs reasonably well at categorizing players into low, medium, or high rating groups.
- MongoDB enables efficient querying and filtering of large player datasets.

## ✅ Highlights
- Full-stack approach: data analysis, NoSQL querying, and machine learning
- Clean and modular notebook structure
- Real-world applicable data pipeline using Python
